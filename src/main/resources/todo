Receive responses in DynamoDB and request them back to create the final string

ChatGPT prompt
I am making a browser game in which 6 players connect and are assigned Roles. They then enter text based on prompts relevant to other players roles. When players submit their answers, they will be saved by the game. At the end of the game all of the text is combined together into a single string.
I want the game to be hosted on a website and users can connect to it from separate devices and wifis. I want to write the backend in java. What technologies could I use to accomplish this?

add src/main/java/com/example/telimprompturevised/AWSAccessKeys.java to .gitignore
